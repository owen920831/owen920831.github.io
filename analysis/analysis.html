                    In the opening paragraph [<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], 
                    the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. 
                    First, it contains the keyword <q>dementia</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. 
                    In addition, the key phrases before symptoms emerge indicates that the focus 
                    will be on early detection of dementia.

                    <q>
                        GEORGETOWN, Calif. — Waves of fire swept through the Sierra Nevada forest, churning up smoke and leaving charred vegetation behind — all under the watchful eye of a heavy-duty drone. Instruments around the perimeter snatched up samples of the singed particles spewing into the air.
                        Prescribed burns, an age-old practice that rids forests of the small trees, brush and other matter than can fuel wildfires, are getting a 21st-century upgrade.
                        With climate change parching the land and increasing wildfire hazards, scientists are beginning to use cutting-edge technology and computer modeling to make controlled, low-intensity burns safer, more effective and less disruptive to nearby communities.
                        "Fire has made us civilized, but we still don't understand it fully," said Tirtha Banerjee of the University of California, Irvine, as he watched a tall heap of dead tree limbs go up in flames.
                        As useful as prescribed burns can be for maintaining forests, they are tough to carry out — costly, labor-intensive, contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather. 
                        <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">And even well-planned burns can turn disastrous, as when a fire started by the United States Forest Service this spring was transformed by gusting winds into New Mexico's largest wildfire on record.</span>

                <!-- Write the summary of each section with a sentence and explain them. And also add some q in paragraph -->

                        <b>[<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>] - Early detection is better than late treatments</b>
                        <p>
                            The topic of this section is made very clear in the first quoted statement in this section <q>Early detection is key</q>, 
                            and the rest of the section talks about why early detection is better, which is 
                            particularly indicated by the key phrase <q>the drugs are administered too late to be helpful</q>.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>[<a href="example.html#sec2">Sec. #2</a>] - Current approaches are expensive and may be unavailable</b>
                        <p>
                            In the first statement of the section, 
                            the key phrase <q>For now</q> implies that this section focuses on the current approaches to the detection of dementia. 
                            Crucially, in the last statement, 
                            the author points of the problems with the current approaches using keywords or phrases like <q>expensive</q>,
                            <q>invasive</q>, and <q>not available</q>.
                        </p>

						<b>Para #1</b> - Section #2 is the first paragraph that follows the opening paragraph, 
                        so its first paragraph naturally carries on to elaborate on the main topic. 
                        In the first sentence <q>Early detection is key for intervention...</q>, 
                        the key phrase <q>Early detection</q> of dementia is linked back to the main topic of the essay, 
                        which creates a natural transition into the subtopic.

                        <b>Para #1</b> - In the second sentence of the first paragraph <q>Such efforts could help...</q>, the author uses the phrase <q>such effort</q> to refer to <q>early detection</q> in the previous sentence, which is a strategy involving 
                        the use of <b>demonstrative adjective</b> to emphasize the focus of the current writing.

                <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
                <p>
                    In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding 
                    whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding 
                    of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">there are more advantages than disadvantages to use 
                    your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared.</span>

                    <q> Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, 
                        chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. 
                        Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, 
                        he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. 
                        To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. 
                        And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, 
                        but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, 
                        he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”
